# Learning Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This is my repository for the the things that I have learned about implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.

1. univariate_linear_regression.ipynb<br />
Learned about computing the cost for univariate linear regression using mean squared error and applying gradient descent to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost. The dataset used is a mock dataset using numpy array.
