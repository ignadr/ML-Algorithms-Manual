# Learning Machine Learning Algorithms From Scratch

This is my repository for the the things that I have learned about implementing machine learning algorithms from scratch.

## 1. [univariate_linear_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/ignadr/ML-Algorithms-Manual/blob/main/univariate_linear_regression.ipynb)<br />
Learned about univariate linear regression, computing the cost using mean squared error, and applying gradient descent to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost. The dataset used is a mock dataset using numpy array.
<br />
<br />
## 2. [experience_vs_salary.ipynb](https://github.com/ignadr/ML-Algorithms-Manual/blob/main/experience_vs_salary.ipynb)<br />
Implementing the cost function and gradient descent for univariate linear regression to a dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/).<br />

<br />
<br />
## 3. [multiple_linear_regression.ipynb](https://github.com/ignadr/ML-Algorithms-Manual/blob/main/multiple_linear_regression.ipynb)<br />
Learned about multiple linear regression, computing the cost using mean squared error, and applying gradient descent to find the optimal parameters that minimize the cost. The dataset used is a mock dataset using numpy array.
<br />
<br />
## 4. [auto_mpg.ipynb](https://github.com/ignadr/ML-Algorithms-Manual/blob/main/auto_mpg.ipynb)
Implementing the cost function and gradient descent for multiple linear regression to a dataset from [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/9/auto+mpg)<br />
Initially, I implemented univariate linear regression using horsepower as feature and mpg (miles per gallon) as the target. However, the dataset has multiple features other than horsepower. So, I decided I will use it for multiple linear regression.<br />

## 5. [student_performance_multiple_LR.ipynb](https://github.com/ignadr/ML-Algorithms-Manual/blob/main/student_performance_multiple_LR.ipynb)
Still on the topic of multiple linear regression, I want to try it with another dataset. However, I also try implementing z-score normalization and splitting the dataset into training and testing set.<br />
